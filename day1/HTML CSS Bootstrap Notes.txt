HTML Notes:

To develop/edit a html file in the browser itself:
S1: Click on 3 verticle dots on top right corner (Browser Menu)
S2: More Tools
S3: Developer Tools
S4: Sources -> File system -> Add Folder to Workspace -> ALLOW
Open the file to edit

* The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).

* HTML Elements can be NESTED:
e.g.
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>

* HTML is case-insensitive language.

* For quotes, Double or single can be used, but both cannot be used in the same line.

* PROPER USE OF QUOTES
<a href='http://www.example.com' title='Isn't this fun?'>A link to my example.</a>

THE ABOVE WONT WORK. Instead, you need to do this:

<a href='http://www.example.com' title='Isn&apos;t this fun?'>A link to my example.</a>

* To include the Special characters of HTML in the text:
Literal 	character reference
<	    	&lt;
>			&gt;
"			&quot;
'			&apos;
&			&amp;

ATTRIBUTES:

* href: This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link. For example: href="https://www.mozilla.org/".

* title: The title attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to. For example, title="The Mozilla homepage".
This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.

* target: The target attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link. For example, target="_blank" will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.

BOOLEAN ATTRIBUTES:

<input type="text" disabled="disabled">
As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:

<!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -->
<input type="text" disabled>

<!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute -->
<input type="text">
