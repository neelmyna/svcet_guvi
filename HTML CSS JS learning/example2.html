		String rotation based on squares 
		You are given a list of strings each having 2 components to it - word and integer. These 2 components are separted by :.
		o If the square of digits in the number component is even, then you must rotate the word to the right by 1.
		o If the square of digits in the number component is odd, then you must rotate the word to the left by 2.
		Finally, print the rotated word.
		Example Input:
		rhdt:246,gftd:1246
		Output:
		trhd
		ftdgh
Explanation:
		2*2+4*4+6*6 = 56 which is even so rotate rhdt --> trhd
		1*1+2*2+4*4+6*6 = 57 which is odd so rotate ftdgh -> ghftd
